# Dara Experimentation Directory

This directory contains control scripts for compiling, and running model checking experiments on etcd.

 * run.sh installs the model checker, and runs a 3 node execution of insturmented etcd.
 * modcluster.sh run vanilia etcd, mainly for sanity checking and benchmarking.
 
 Many files are generated by the runtime. DaraSharedMem is a shared chunck of memory the 
 scheduler uses to communicate with inteurmented runtimes. etcd[1-9].log are state traces generated by etcd instances.
 Schedule.json is a global schedule recored by the scheduler. s.out is the scheduler output, it is used for monitering
 during runs, i.e. `tail -f s.out`
 
 In the future this directory will contain evaluation targets and actual experiments.
